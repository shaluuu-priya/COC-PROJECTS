📘 Project Overview

This project simulates and analyzes dice rolls in the game Ludo.
It helps understand the distribution and probability of dice outcomes when rolled multiple times — showing how randomness works in a real game scenario.

The program takes user input for the number of rolls, generates random dice values (1–6), and displays:

The frequency of each dice face

The percentage distribution

The most frequently rolled number (mode)

It’s a simple, interactive project to demonstrate concepts of:

Loops

Arrays

Random number generation

Basic data analysis in C

⚙️ Features

✅ User enters how many times the dice will roll
✅ Random outcomes generated using rand()
✅ Frequency count for each face (1–6)
✅ Probability (%) for each number
✅ Highlights the most frequent outcome
✅ Clear console-based report output

💻 Technologies Used

Language: C

Compiler: GCC / Code::Blocks / VS Code

Header Files: <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <time.h>

🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

Random number generation using rand() and srand(time(0))

Arrays for frequency tracking

Loops and conditional logic

Basic statistics (frequency and probability)

🧾 Sample Output
Enter number of dice rolls: 10

Dice roll outcomes:
6 3 1 4 6 2 5 3 6 1

Frequency of each number:
1: 2 times
2: 1 time
3: 2 times
4: 1 time
5: 1 time
6: 3 times

Percentage distribution:
1: 20.00%
2: 10.00%
3: 20.00%
4: 10.00%
5: 10.00%
6: 30.00%

Most frequent outcome: 6 🎯

📈 Learning Outcome

Through this project, students learn:

How randomization works in C

How to use arrays and loops effectively

How to convert data into simple statistics
